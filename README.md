This project is built using basic JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I have created a responsive website that adjusts seamlessly across different devices, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops.

In this application, when a user clicks on the 'Add to Bag' button for a product, the item is added to their virtual shopping bag. The user can then click on the bag icon to view a summary of their selected items. This summary page provides an overview of all items added to the bag, including the option to delete any unwanted items. Additionally, the total price, including applicable taxes, is calculated and displayed, offering the user a clear understanding of their purchase cost before proceeding to checkout.

The functionality ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience, making the shopping process straightforward and efficient. By implementing these features, I aimed to enhance user interaction and satisfaction, demonstrating my skills in front-end development and my ability to create practical, user-friendly web applications.

This project has not only strengthened my proficiency in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML but has also given me valuable insights into responsive design, user interface optimization, and the overall e-commerce workflow. Working on this project has prepared me for more advanced development tasks and has fueled my eagerness to further my skills, particularly in the ReactJS framework.
